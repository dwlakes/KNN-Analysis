K to the Nearest Neighbor
This algorithm takes data from multiple groups of data sets, then estimates which group another data set might belong to. In this case, the algorithm will be analyzing 5 different literature pieces from two others (10 works in total), and two works from "mystery" authors. For our purposes, both of the mystery authors will be one from each of the previously stated authors. In total there will be 12 pieces, 6 from each author, with one "unknown" author from both. The algorithm will estimate which author the mystery author is.

Meet the Authors
Jacob Abbott
Author A is Jacob Abbott (1803-1879), an author from the United States specializing in historical figures. Three of his selected pieces are from his "Makers of History" series, focusing on Romulus, Xerxes, and Gengis Khan. One piece, in a similar vein, is about Cleopatra. The final piece is a fictional piece written for a younger audience. This author was selected becaue I assumed that his historical pieces will be written in a similiar style, making trends easy to find.

Matthew Arnold
Author B is Matthew Arnold (1822-1888), an English poet. His selected pieces for analysis are "On Translating Homer", "Culture and Anarchy", a compilation of poems, "Celtic Literature", and "Selection from the Prose Works." While Arnold and Abbott are from a similar time period, Arnold was selected because it is assumed that he will use a different dialect of English than Abbott. Additionally, his writing style will also be different from Abbott's.

"Unknown" Authors
The first unknown piece will be Abbott's "Cyrus the Great Makers of History." The second unkown piece will be Arnold's "Discourses in America."
